Here are the eligibility criteria for applying for the Kinderzuschlag (child supplement) structured in SHACL format:

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

        sh:minInclusive 900 ;
        sh:maxInclusive 3000 ;
        sh:message "The family's gross income must be at least 900 euros (couples) or 600 euros (single parents) per month." ;
    ] ;
    
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:sufficientFunds ;
        sh:hasValue true ;
        sh:message "The family must have sufficient funds for their maintenance when combined with the Kinderzuschlag and possibly housing benefit." ;
    ] ;
    
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:wealth ;
        sh:maxInclusive 55000 ;
        sh:message "The family's wealth must not exceed certain limits (e.g., 55,000 euros for two people)." ;
    ] ;
    
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:childCount ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:message "The family must have at least one child." ;
    ] ;
.

ex:ChildShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:age ;
        sh:maxInclusive 24 ;
    ] ;
    
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:maritalStatus ;
        sh:not [
            sh:hasValue ex:Married ;
            sh:hasValue ex:InRegisteredPartnership ;
        ] ;
    ] ;
.

This SHACL shape ensures that families meet the specific criteria for receiving Kinderzuschlag, 
such as having children under 25 who are not married, receiving Kindergeld, having sufficient income and 
wealth, and having enough funds for family maintenance.
