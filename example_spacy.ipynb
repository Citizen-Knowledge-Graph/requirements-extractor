# Step 1: Install Required Libraries
# Install required libraries
!pip install requests beautifulsoup4 spacy pandas
!python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm

# Step 2: Import Libraries and Load spaCy Model (since the website used in the example is in German, we use the 'de_core_news_sm model'

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import spacy

# Load spaCy's German model
nlp = spacy.load('de_core_news_sm')

# Step 3: Define URL and Fetch Webpage Content

# Define the URL of the website you want to scrape
url = 'https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/familie-und-kinder/kinderzuschlag-verstehen/kinderzuschlag-anspruch-hoehe-dauer'

# Send a GET request to the website
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful

    # Parse the content of the request with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Step 4: Extract Eligibility Conditions
# Extract content from specific HTML elements (modify selectors as necessary)

# Define SHACL shapes template

    ] .
"""

# Convert conditions to SHACL format
shacl_shapes = ""
for i, condition in enumerate(eligibility_conditions, start=1):
    shape = shapes_template.replace("{description}", condition)
    shacl_shapes += shape

# Print SHACL shapes

# Save SHACL shapes to a file (optional)
